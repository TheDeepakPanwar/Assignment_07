Q1. Write a program that allows users to enter five words (in the form of c-type strings) and concatenates these words in an alphabetical order with the first character of each word determining the order. For example, if there is a word “africa” and another word “europe”; africa would come before europe in the concatenated string.

Q2. Write a program that searches for the largest three numbers in an array randomly populated by a user.

   
Q3. Write a function that takes an array an a parameter and modifies every element by multiplying it with the current values of elements before and after it. The element before the first element is considered to be a 1; similarly the element after the last element is also considered a 1. The first is first multiplied, the second element is subsequently multiplied by the new value of the first element and the third element, and so on.


Q4. Write a function that finds that first element that repeats itself in an array.
